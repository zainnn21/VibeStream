## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your own instance of the bot up and running.

### 1. Prerequisites

- [Bun.js](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) (v1.0.0 or higher)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (LTS version) - Required to use `npm` for one specific package.
- A **Discord Bot Account** with a Token and Client ID. (Get this from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)).

### 2. Bot Setup & Invite

1.  **Create a Bot:** Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), create a "New Application," and add a "Bot" to it.
2.  **Enable Intents:** In the "Bot" tab, enable the **`GUILD_VOICE_STATES`** Privileged Gateway Intent.
3.  **Invite the Bot:**
    - Go to the "OAuth2" -> "URL Generator" tab.
    - Select the following scopes:
      - `bot`
      - `applications.commands`
    - In "Bot Permissions," select:
      - `View Channels`
      - `Send Messages`
      - `Connect`
      - `Speak`
    - Copy the generated URL, paste it into your browser, and invite the bot to your test server.

### 3. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

2.  **Install dependencies with Npm:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install yt-dlp manually (recommended)**
    Instead of using NPM, download it directly from the official GitHub:

    - Visit: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp
    - Download:
      - Windows: yt-dlp.exe
      - Linux/macOS: yt-dlp (then run chmod +x yt-dlp)
    - Place it in your project folder

4.  **Create your environment file:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your credentials:
    ```.env
    DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_BOT_TOKEN
    CLIENT_ID=YOUR_BOTS_APPLICATION_ID
    GUILD_ID=YOUR_TEST_SERVERS_ID
    ```

### 4. Deploy Commands

Before starting the bot, you must register its `/` commands with Discord.

_Run this command **one time** (and again any time you add a new command):_

```bash
node src/deploy-commands.js
```

### 5. Run the Bot

You're all set! Start the bot.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This bot now uses **Node.js** instead of Bun for runtime.  
> Bun previously caused issues with streaming multiple songs and handling `yt-dlp` reliably. Node.js provides a stable and fully supported environment for audio streaming with Discord.js.

```bash
npm run devnode
```

## ü§ñ Available Commands

- `/play [query]` - Plays a song from a YouTube URL or search query.
- `/playlist [playlist URL]` - Adds multiple songs to the queue at once.
- `/stop` - Stops the music, clears the queue, and disconnects the bot.
- `/skip` - Skips the current song and plays the next in the queue.
- `/queue` - Displays the current song queue (up to 10 songs).
- `/shuffle` - Shuffles the upcoming songs in the queue.
- `/help` - Shows the help message with all available commands.

## Visual Flow

Pipe Mode (Recommended):

`yt-dlp ‚Üí FFmpeg (convert audio to s16le or PCM) ‚Üí stdout pipe ‚Üí Discord.js ‚Üí Voice Channel`

Discord.js secara internal mengencode PCM menjadi Opus sebelum dikirim ke voice channel

- FFmpeg is required to ensure audio format compatibility.
- Works consistently on both Windows and Linux/Docker environments.

## Docker Support

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
